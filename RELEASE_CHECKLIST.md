---

### 3. Pre-Release Testing (CRITICAL)

#### 3.1 Test in Clean Environment
```bash
# Create fresh virtual environment
python3 -m venv /tmp/coldstore-test
source /tmp/coldstore-test/bin/activate

# Install from built wheel
pip install /Users/jfasnacht/Projects/coldstore/dist/coldstore-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl

# Test commands
coldstore --version
coldstore --help
coldstore freeze --help

# Create test archive
mkdir -p /tmp/test-project
echo "test" > /tmp/test-project/file.txt
coldstore freeze /tmp/test-project /tmp/test-archives --milestone "Test"

# Verify archive
coldstore verify /tmp/test-archives/test-project-*.tar.gz

# Inspect archive
coldstore inspect /tmp/test-archives/test-project-*.tar.gz

# Cleanup
deactivate
rm -rf /tmp/coldstore-test /tmp/test-project /tmp/test-archives
```

**Expected**: All commands should work without errors.

#### 3.2 Manual QA Scenarios

**Test 1: Real Project Freeze**
```bash
cd ~/Projects/coldstore
coldstore freeze . /tmp/coldstore-test-archive \
    --milestone "v1.0.0 pre-release test" \
    --note "Testing freeze on actual coldstore project" \
    --exclude ".venv" \
    --exclude "dist" \
    --exclude ".pytest_cache"

coldstore verify /tmp/coldstore-test-archive/coldstore-*.tar.gz
coldstore inspect /tmp/coldstore-test-archive/coldstore-*.tar.gz
```

**Test 2: Dry-Run Accuracy**
```bash
cd ~/Projects/coldstore
coldstore freeze . /tmp/test --milestone "Test" --dry-run > /tmp/dryrun.txt
coldstore freeze . /tmp/test --milestone "Test" > /tmp/actual.txt

# Compare file counts (should be similar)
grep -c "files" /tmp/dryrun.txt
grep -c "files" /tmp/actual.txt
```

**Test 3: Git Metadata Capture**
```bash
# Ensure clean Git state
cd ~/Projects/coldstore
git status

# Freeze with Git metadata
coldstore freeze . /tmp/test --milestone "Git test"

# Inspect and verify Git info is captured
coldstore inspect /tmp/test/coldstore-*.tar.gz | grep -A 5 "Git Metadata"
```

---

### 4. Test PyPI Publication (REQUIRED)

**‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT skip this step!** Always test on Test PyPI first.

#### 4.1 Configure Test PyPI
```bash
cd ~/Projects/coldstore
poetry config repositories.test-pypi https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
```

#### 4.2 Generate Test PyPI Token
1. Go to https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/token/
2. Create API token for "Entire account"
3. Copy token

#### 4.3 Publish to Test PyPI
```bash
# Set token as environment variable (or use poetry config)
export POETRY_PYPI_TOKEN_TEST_PYPI="pypi-..."

# Publish
poetry publish -r test-pypi

# Or without env var:
poetry publish -r test-pypi -u __token__ -p pypi-YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

#### 4.4 Test Installation from Test PyPI
```bash
# Create clean environment
python3 -m venv /tmp/testpypi-install
source /tmp/testpypi-install/bin/activate

# Install from Test PyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ \
            --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ \
            coldstore

# Test commands
coldstore --version  # Should show 1.0.0
coldstore --help

# Cleanup
deactivate
rm -rf /tmp/testpypi-install
```

**Expected**: Package installs and commands work correctly.

#### 5.2 Minor Linting Issues (Optional Fix)
There are 10 minor linting warnings (line length, unused import). These are non-blocking but can be fixed if desired:

```bash
# Auto-fix some issues
poetry run ruff check --fix coldstore

# Or manually address the issues in:
# - coldstore/cli/app.py (line length, f-string, complexity)
# - coldstore/core/verifier.py (line length)
# - coldstore/utils/formatters.py (unused import)
```

project milestones."

# Push tag (triggers GitHub Actions release workflow)
git push origin v1.0.0
```

#### 6.3 Monitor GitHub Actions
1. Go to: https://github.com/janfasnacht/coldstore/actions
2. Watch for "Release" workflow triggered by `v1.0.0` tag
3. Workflow will:
   - Run tests on Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
   - Build packages (wheel + sdist)
   - Publish to PyPI (using `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret)
   - Create GitHub release with changelog

**Expected duration**: 5-10 minutes

If workflow fails:
- Check logs at: https://github.com/janfasnacht/coldstore/actions
- Common issues:
  - Missing `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret (see step 2.4)
  - Version mismatch (tag vs pyproject.toml)
  - Test failures (run `poetry run pytest` locally)

#### 6.4 Verify PyPI Publication
After workflow succeeds:

1. Visit: https://pypi.org/project/coldstore/
2. Verify:
   - Version shows `1.0.0`
   - Description displays correctly
   - Metadata (keywords, classifiers) is present
   - README renders properly

#### 6.5 Test Production Installation
```bash
# Clean environment
python3 -m venv /tmp/coldstore-prod-test
source /tmp/coldstore-prod-test/bin/activate

# Install from PyPI
pipx install coldstore
# or: pip install coldstore

# Test
coldstore --version  # Should show 1.0.0
coldstore --help

# Create real archive
mkdir -p /tmp/test-project
echo "test" > /tmp/test-project/file.txt
coldstore freeze /tmp/test-project /tmp/archives --milestone "Test"

# Verify and inspect
coldstore verify /tmp/archives/test-project-*.tar.gz
coldstore inspect /tmp/archives/test-project-*.tar.gz

# Cleanup
deactivate
rm -rf /tmp/coldstore-prod-test /tmp/test-project /tmp/archives
```

## üìä Success Criteria

All of these should be ‚úÖ:

- [ ] Package published to PyPI at https://pypi.org/project/coldstore/
- [ ] `pipx install coldstore` works
- [ ] GitHub release created at https://github.com/janfasnacht/coldstore/releases/tag/v1.0.0

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### GitHub Actions Fails

**Problem**: Release workflow fails on PyPI publish

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if token is set correctly
# Go to: https://github.com/janfasnacht/coldstore/settings/secrets/actions
# Verify PYPI_API_TOKEN exists

# Or publish manually:
cd ~/Projects/coldstore
poetry build
poetry publish  # Uses POETRY_PYPI_TOKEN_PYPI env var or prompts
```

### Version Mismatch Error

**Problem**: "Version mismatch: tag=1.0.0, pyproject.toml=1.0.0-dev"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify pyproject.toml has correct version
grep "version" pyproject.toml  # Should show: version = "1.0.0"

# If not, fix and re-tag:
# 1. Edit pyproject.toml
# 2. Commit changes
# 3. Delete old tag: git tag -d v1.0.0 && git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0
# 4. Create new tag: git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
# 5. Push: git push origin v1.0.0
```

### PyPI Package Page Renders Incorrectly

**Problem**: README doesn't display well on PyPI

**Solution**:
```bash
# PyPI uses README.md specified in pyproject.toml
# Verify markdown is valid:
# - No relative links to local files
# - Images must use absolute URLs
# - GitHub-flavored markdown may not render

# Test locally:
poetry build
# Then upload and check: https://pypi.org/project/coldstore/
```

### Installation from PyPI Fails

**Problem**: `pip install coldstore` fails

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if package exists on PyPI
curl https://pypi.org/pypi/coldstore/json

# Try installing specific version
pip install coldstore==1.0.0

# Check dependencies
pip install coldstore --verbose
```

## üìù Post-Release Notes

After successful v1.0.0 release:

1. **Update development version** (for future work):
   ```bash
   # In pyproject.toml, change:
   version = "1.0.0" ‚Üí version = "1.1.0-dev"

   git add pyproject.toml
   git commit -m "Bump version to 1.1.0-dev for development"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Close Issue #22**:
   ```bash

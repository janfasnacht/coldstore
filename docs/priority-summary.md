# Priority Summary - Project Archiver Improvements

Based on your feedback, here's a prioritized action plan focusing on the highest-value improvements:

## High Priority Items

### 1. **Archive Splitting** (Issue #4) ‚úÇÔ∏è 
- Split by size or directory structure
- Handle multi-part archives gracefully
- Create consistent naming and metadata for each part
- **Rationale**: CRITICAL - 200GB+ archives are impractical to download, error-prone, and computationally expensive. This is a real-world blocker.

### 2. **Enhanced Progress Reporting** ‚ú®
- Add real-time feedback during long operations
- Use `tqdm` or `rich` for progress bars
- Show current file, speeds, and ETA
- **Rationale**: Essential for user experience with large archives

### 3. **Resume/Checkpoint Support** üîÑ
- Save progress state for interrupted operations
- Allow resuming failed archives/uploads
- **Rationale**: Critical for reliability with large datasets

### 4. **Better CLI Tool** (Issue #1) üõ†Ô∏è
- Migrate from argparse to Typer or Click
- Enable `archive-project` command via proper packaging
- **Rationale**: Professional tool should have professional CLI

### 5. **Dry-run Option** (Issue #5) üëÅÔ∏è
- Preview operations without execution
- Show what would be archived/excluded/uploaded
- **Rationale**: Low effort, high safety value

### 6. **Rclone Input Support** (Issue #3) ‚òÅÔ∏è
- Enable cloud sources as input
- Support cloud-to-cloud workflows
- **Rationale**: Powerful feature for modern workflows

## Medium Priority Items

### 7. **Archive Verification** ‚úÖ
- Add `--verify` option to test integrity
- Compare metadata before/after
- **Rationale**: Important for trust in cold storage

### 8. **Enhanced Exclusion Patterns** üö´
- Support .gitignore style patterns
- Add size-based exclusions
- **Rationale**: Better control over what gets archived

### 9. **Multiple Storage Providers** üì¶
- Keep rclone as primary method
- Maybe add native S3 for simplicity
- **Rationale**: Balance flexibility with maintainability

## New High-Priority Items (Your Additions)

### 11. **Professional Codebase Structure** üìö
Split into 3 sub-tasks:
1. **Project Structure**
   - Organize into proper package structure
   - Separate CLI from core logic
   - Add proper logging

2. **Documentation**
   - Create QUICKSTART.md alongside README
   - Add API documentation
   - Include examples directory

3. **Testing & CI**
   - Expand test suite
   - Add GitHub Actions workflows
   - Simple Makefile for development
   - Keep it lean but professional

### 12. **Easy Installation Options** üì•
- **pipx** as primary recommendation (isolated environment)
- **pip** install from PyPI
- **Poetry** for developers
- Pre-built binaries (via PyInstaller/Nuitka) for non-Python users
- Docker image for consistent environment
- Clear installation guide with multiple paths

## Implementation Strategy

### Must-Have Features (Core Functionality)
1. Archive splitting (#4) - Without this, large archives are unusable
2. Progress reporting - Users need feedback
3. Resume support - Reliability for large operations
4. Better CLI (#1) - Professional interface
5. Dry-run (#5) - Safety first

### Should-Have Features (Enhanced Usability)
1. Professional codebase structure (#11)
2. Easy installation options (#12)
3. Rclone input (#3)
4. Archive verification
5. Enhanced exclusions

### Nice-to-Have Features (Future Enhancements)
1. Multiple storage providers (beyond rclone)
2. Configuration file support
3. Security enhancements
4. Multiple metadata formats

## Key Decisions Based on Your Feedback

1. **Archive splitting is CRITICAL** - Not a nice-to-have, but a core requirement
2. **Keep rclone as primary cloud provider** - Simpler maintenance
3. **This is a cold storage tool, not a backup tool** - No incremental archives
4. **Target researchers and small teams** - Keep simple, avoid enterprise complexity
5. **Configuration files are low priority** - Command-line focused
6. **Security features are nice-to-have** - Not core functionality

This approach prioritizes solving real-world problems (huge archives) while maintaining simplicity and building toward a professional tool.
